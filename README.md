URL to GitHub Repository:

URL to Your Coding Assignment Video: 

Instructions:

In Visual Studio Code, write the code that accomplishes the objectives listed below and ensures that the code compiles and runs as directed. 

Create a new repository on GitHub for this week’s assignments and push this document, with your project code, to the repository.

Include the URLs for this week’s repository and video where instructed.

Submit this document as a .PDF file in the LMS. 

Coding Steps:

Create a full CRUD application of your choice using either an API or local Array.

Use an existing API with AJAX to interact with it. 

If you do not use an API, store the entities you will create, read, update, and delete in an array.

Use a form to post new entities.

Build a way for users to update or delete entities

Use Bootstrap and CSS to style your project. 

Recommended API:

MockAPI is a great recommendation for this project! Get more tips on CRUD with MockAPI!       

Video Steps:

Create a video, up to five minutes max, showing and explaining how your project works with an emphasis on the portions you contributed. 

This video should be done using screen share and voice over. 

This can easily be done using Zoom, although you don't have to use Zoom, it's just what we recommend. 

You can create a new meeting, start screen sharing, and start recording. 

This will create a video recording on your computer. 

This should then be uploaded to a publicly accessible site, such as YouTube. 

Ensure the link you share is PUBLIC or UNLISTED!

If it is not accessible by your grader, your project will be graded based on what they can access.
